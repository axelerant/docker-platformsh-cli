# Platform.sh CLI in Docker

This is a downstream version of [pjcdawkins/docker-psh-cli](https://github.com/pjcdawkins/docker-psh-cli). It only adds known hosts for the common platform.sh git servers so that you don't have to in your own files. See this [issue](https://github.com/pjcdawkins/docker-psh-cli/pull/1) for more context.

## Background

This replaces our earlier [Docker image](https://github.com/axelerant/docker-platformshcli) (now archived) as that had a few problems. We ultimately decided to extend a community Docker image with our small customisation.

## Usage

_TODO_
